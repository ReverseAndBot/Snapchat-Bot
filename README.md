### Snapchat API Bot (SaaS solution)

- Based on the hidden Snapchat iOS API.

- Working as of January 2025 (watch a video of the working Snapchat API bot below).

- Please remember: Most people use poor Snapchat bots based on Android, a very low number uses Snapchat bots based on iOS. Stay safe and use iOS!

- Compatible with Snapchat 12.x and 13.x for ***iOS*** (up to version 13.22.0.61 for iOS)

- Tokens for Snapchat 12.x and 13.x for ***Android*** optionally available on request

- Complete SaaS [^1] solution:

  - Everything runs in the background on our servers 24/7.
  - Advanced "web panel" solution (2 frontend servers, 10+ backend servers).
  - Setup the workflows once with your favorite browser.
  - No installation required.
  - No poor Android solution (bots for iOS are safer than bots for Android).
  - No poor ADB bridge (no connected devices).
  - No poor signer being used. C++ example code here: https://github.com/ReverseAndBot/Snapchat-Bot/blob/main/SnapchatGenerateTokens.cpp
  - No poor browser module.
  - No Appium or XCUITest solution.
  - ***No jailbreaks or tweaks used*** (since no physical devices or emulators are required).
  - ***No phones required, no tablets required, no emulators required, no browser emulation required, no own server required.***

- We also offer:

  - Bot coding for social media apps, dating apps, other apps based on the hidden private APIs for iOS etc.
  - Safari for iOS automation with a perfect anti device detection (XCUITest coded in Swift 5/6, no poor insecure instable Appium solution), ...
  - ***Lists of API endpoints and required signatures, patched iOS apps (with SSL unpinning, jailbreak/device detection/... etc. bypassing, many more)***
  - Trainings and white papers for you to set up your private bots on your own, with a perfect protection, hidden operation and anti-detection methods
