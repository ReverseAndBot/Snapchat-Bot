***Current news:***

  - January 21st, 2025, 08:05 (UTC+1)/08:05 AM (UTC+1)

     - New! Email newsletter sign up
   
       It's the best way to stay in touch with future customers, to send out Snapchat API bot subscription links, to send out waiting list entry links etc. Independent from GitHub and any volatile messenger app.

  - January 19th, 2025, 06:00 (UTC+1)/06:00 AM (UTC+1)

     - New! Support of ***Snapchat 13.24.0.38 for iOS*** (current release)
   
       Do you need screenshots with proofs, friends?

     - ***To be published here during the next 24 hours***
     
       We're going to publish a classic email newsletter sign-up link during the next 48 hours at this page. It's the best way to stay in touch with future customers, to send out Snapchat API bot subscription links, to send out waiting list entry links etc. Independent from GitHub and any volatile messenger app.

     - Current information about a fake campaign:

       A small Snapchat bot (for Android only) provider from Russia pretends that members of our team do work/used to work as paid developers for him. That's not true.

       None of our team members ever worked as an external consultant, developer, reverse engineer, administrator etc. for any external company regarding Snapchat. Especially not supporting the poor Snapchat for Android variation everybody uses to spam (very high detection risk, high ban risk compared to Snapchat 13.x for iOS, low account lifetime).

       Since he operates his business from Russia and Russia has declared European countries the war almost 3 years ago (February 2022) our lawyers have no chance to start legal actions against him, his false advertising and also his blackmailing strategies. Our lawyers recommended us to take a different route instead. We will follow this advice soon.

     - ***Time for you to look forward*** to the upcoming extension of our famous ***Snapchat of iOS account creation service***!
  
  - January 15th, 2025, 21:55 (UTC+1)/09:55 PM (UTC+1)

    - ***The next chunk of subscription slots*** will be available approx. after January 21st, 2025.

      Not all highly customized dedicated hardware will arrive until then. Even the delivery time of the Apple Mac Pro machines with the highest possible configuration takes 5 to 6 weeks now (as of January 15th).

      And since it's no big secret anymore that we use large GPU stacks to do most parts of the encryption, encoding and signing (instead of connected iPhones), we clearly need these customized hardware parts. The costs are up to US$ 15,000 per machine.

      You can find more information below.

    - ***Snapchat for iOS account creation service*** will be back soon.
   
      We will also extend the server capacities to offer further slots of the famous Snapchat for iOS account creation service (established in July 2024) very soon.

    - ***Coming soon!*** We're going to publish a classic email newsletter sign-up link soon at this GitHub repository. It's the best way to stay in touch with future customers, to send out Snapchat API bot subscription links, to send out waiting list entry links etc. 

      So please visit this GitHub page daily now to receive the newsletter link. (All incoming entries will be manually reviewed.)

  - January 12th, 2025, 18:14 (UTC+1)/06:14 PM (UTC+1)

    - New! Support of Snapchat 13.23.0.34 for iOS (current release)

    - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c4a9c8-a4cf-4fdc-aa28-8f85c6508c97)

    - New! Support of Snapchat 13.23.0.34 for iOS (current release)

  - January 8th, 2025, 10:57 (UTC+1)/10:57 AM (UTC+1)

    - ***Very low entry prices*** starting at low US$ xxx (***lower than US$ 300***, for a limited time and limited number of new customers also ***lower than US$ 200***).

      We are known for ***very low entry prices***. To give everybody a chance to start, even people with a low budget.

      So you will be able to earn the first large bunch of money, ***grow organically in a healthy way*** and ***invest your future profits*** into upgrades, upcoming modules, new features etc.

      ***Don't fall for "unlimited" offers*** based on Android phones/emulators (signers, bridges) or browser emulations (web-snapchat-com)! There is nothing "unlimited" in data centers, colocation rooms, servers, switches, gateways, network uplinks, energy supplies, air condition, huge server housing companies. Sooner or later your Snapchat "provider" will be forced to cut you off.

      Please "star" and "watch" this GitHub repository to be notified on time about the limited sign up links and discounted entry prices.

    - ***No browser emulation***, we use the ***real Snapchat API for iOS***.
   
      As written below ***we don't use dirty tricks*** to ***jeopardize your earnings and Snapchat account lifetime***.

      We still don't use browser emulations (web-snapchat-com), cheap rooted Android phones, iOS jailbreaks, Android/iOS software emulators, bridges, signers, tweaks or other bulls__t.

      Instead we use own, huge, customized, ***dedicated hardware worth up to US$ 15,000 per machine.***

      Did you ever work with a brand new Apple Mac Pro, fully equipped, with the maximum possible configuration? ;-)
    
  - January 6th, 2025, 21:54 (UTC+1)/09:54 PM (UTC+1)

    - New! Support of Snapchat 13.22.0.61 for iOS
    
      Only 8 hours after the public release of Snapchat 13.22.0.61 for iOS at the Apple AppStore our team managed to break the SSL pinning, encryption, encoding, token generation etc. and fully support all new features now also for Snapchat 13.22.0.61

      We didn't use any jailbreaks, debuggers, tweaks or tools like Fr__a, Gh___a or other bulls__t for this iOS milestone again.

    - Coming soon: Public news announcements, email notifications about Snapchat API SaaS bot news (public releases, limited invitation links to subscribe to the Snapchat API SaaS bot, announcements of further available slots, free entries to the next waiting list etc.)
   
    - Please remember to "star" and "watch" this GitHub repository to receive update notifications by GitHub.
